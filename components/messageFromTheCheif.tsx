                        Here is the fifth volume marking completion of a set. In the next volume, things will be different.
                        From layout to content. But the level of articles and selection of news will remain as pleasant as ever.
                        And the layouts, though different, would remain as lovable and eye-catching as you have been accustomed to.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        In months to come, you will get a diet of riveting, research-based articles on topical issues.
                        And there will also be a stream of news reports gathered from all across the globe.
                        Just like you have read in the five previous volumes.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        For now, you will read articles on subjects like <span className="font-semibold">&apos;Smart Grids&apos;</span> and <span className="font-semibold">&apos;Smart Cities.&apos;</span>
                        And there are thought provoking discussions on <span className="font-semibold">&apos;Leadership Crisis&apos;</span> in the profession
                        and on <span className="font-semibold">&apos;Boundaryless Laws.&apos;</span> Every article is painstakingly produced backed by research,
                        careful studies and analyses. You will come to realize that the content can easily be judged as reference material.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As always, the news items are picked from a vast repository of content available to everyone on the internet
                        but hardly of any use because not everyone has the skill or time to search for stories that interest and inspire.
                        In contrast to the usual prosaic and mundane stuff that you often come across elsewhere, you will settle with
                        incisive and investigative reports that will entertain and provide substance.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Add to these, our regular features including interviews and first person accounts and you have a magazine
                        that does not cease to amaze you with its content and presentation.
